# Prevent Project
This Project aims to create a small static website to provide a brief overview of the UK governments Prevent anti extremism programme along with a list of warning signs of possible radicalisation and a contact form for those worried about extremism. (**this is a proof of concept please see links in the credits section for actual government resources**).

The site aims to be easily legible, navigable and accessible for all users and conforms with standard SEO practices to enhance its visibility on the web as it may be a point of contact for those looking for help.
